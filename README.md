Documentation on how to run this program:

(Will assume user knows nothing about python whatsoever. If python 3 is already installed this code may run smoothly, though has only been tested with 3.7 and 3.10, so cannot be guaranteed)

Step 1: Go to site: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/ and download file that matches your computer's system and hardware. Follow any instructions to install program successfully.

Step 2: Download this project from GitHub as a .zip file, extract anywhere

Step 3: Right click on .py file in folder and select Edit with IDLE --> Edit with IDLE 3.10. This will open the .py file in a new window. In this state it can be edited freely so try not to change anything.

Step 4: Once the .py file is open, press f5 or select in the top menu Run --> Run Module. This will open a second window where the code will run. To make calls, follow the instructions that are written, entering inputs on the bottommost line of the window.

Step 5: Enjoy!
